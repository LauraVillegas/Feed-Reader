# Testing Feeds with Jasmine

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The tests were incomplete so I had to complete the tests to make sure the feeds load properly and that the components of the page like the menu toggle button function as expected.

## Getting Started

To clone this game open your terminal, nagivate to the folder where you want the RSS page project nested on and run the following code:

```
clone https://github.com/LauraVillegas/Feed-Reader.git
```

or click [here](https://github.com/LauraVillegas/Feed-Reader/archive/master.zip) to Download.


## Running the Game

* If you downloaded the repo: Open index.html in your preferred browser
* To open the project from Github click [Here] (https://lauravillegas.github.io/Feed-Reader/)


### How to check the tests

By scrolling to the bottom of the page you will find [Jasmine's](https://jasmine.github.io/) feed reader tests. 

* If the test shows any of the lines in red, one of the test conditions are not being fulfilled. You can look further into jasmine/spec/feedreader.js file for more info in what the testing suits conditions are to pass the test. 
* When all the lines have checked green it means all the test have passed and our application is working as expected by test conditions.
